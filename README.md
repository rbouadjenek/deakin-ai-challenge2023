</p>

The **Deakin Simpsons challenge 2023** is a computer vision competition for which the goal is: 


> **Given an image of Simpsons and a natural language question about the image, 
the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer using machine 
learning and deep learning.**


The challenge is designed to provide students with the opportunity to work as team members, to compete with each other, and to enhance the student learning experience by improving their AI modeling, problem-solving, and team-working skills.

# About the task <a name="introduction"></a>

As participants, your goal is to build a machine learning/deep learning model to  answer a natural language **Yes**/**No** question  given an image of Simpsons. 

Once you have built your model, you will have to submit it on the [CodaLab](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/9663?secret_key=0102acb9-fb09-4f23-acc9-9945ffb0f427) platform to be evaluated. 
We evaluate the performance of your model using the [Accuracy](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html)  on a private test set that we have directly collected and labeled from TV show episodes.
Once the evaluation completed, your entry will appear on the leaderboard to see your performance against other competitors.


In the Notebook that we provide for starting, we will take you through  a 6-step process to build a simple model to perform this task as follows:

1. `Setup the environment:` Thie first step consists of setting the environement and downloading the data.
2. `Preprocessing:` The second step is a preprocessing step that consists of resizing, plitting, and piping the input data.
3. `Exploring the data:` The third step consists of a simple data exploration step where you will see samples of the data and some statistics to help you in understanding the data.
4. `Designing the model:` The forth step consists of designing an architecture for the task.
5. `Traning:` The fifth step consists of starting the training process.
6. `Monitoring:` The sixth step consists of monitoring the traning process to investigate possible overfitting.
7. `Submitting:` The seventh and last step will take you through the submission process.

# Eligibility<a name="Eligibility"></a>

The competition is open to all **Deakin's students**. Also, in order to be eligible for any award, the semi-finalists are required to:

- 🚨 Submit your model to the test leaderboard.
- 🚨 Submit a report, which describes the solution by the stipulated deadline  (4 pages **maximum**, using the [Master Article Template – LaTeX](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt), with the “sigconf” option). Please use the following [easychair link]() to submit your report. The reports will eventually be made publicly available on the website.
- 🚨 Provide a link of the Github repo of the solution in the report. The submitted codes and reports may be inspected to check the validity of the solution.

# Why should you participate? <a name="Benefit"></a>

Often, students work theoretically and experiment with data themselves. They rarely get the chance to practice before working with data in the real-world. With this competition, you have the opportunity to interact and compete in solving real-life problems.

This competition serves many purposes:

- First, it is the perfect place to learn best practices in AI, accrue feedback on your work, and augment your skills. 
- Second, it is a channel for problem-solving and brainstorming by probing the multitude of crowdsourced solutions to a problem.
- Third, this competition is an opportunity to push boundaries and encourage creativity among the best and the brightest in AI. 
- Fourth, the experience you get is invaluable in preparing you to understand what goes into finding feasible solutions for big data.
- Finally, in addition to the non-cash award that you will gain if you are on the podium (among the three winners), the school official award that will be given to you provides an invaluable recognition for the challenging work you will have achieved.  In particular, the award can raise your credibility as a PhD scholarship applicant or as a job seeker because your application will be viewed differently compared to other applicants and, as a result, you will be in a better position to receive more scholarship offers or job offers.


# Are you competitive enough to participate? <a name="participate"></a>

Follow these steps:

1. Register to the [CodaLab](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/accounts/login/?next=/) platform, then register to the competition on [CodaLab](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/9663?secret_key=0102acb9-fb09-4f23-acc9-9945ffb0f427).
3. You can participate individually or in a team. There cannot be more than 3 students in a team **(all team members need to register to the competition)**.
4. To find team members, you can post a message on the discussion forum on [CodaLab](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/9663?secret_key=0102acb9-fb09-4f23-acc9-9945ffb0f427). Once you have built your team, the team leader needs to contact [Mohamed Reda Bouadjenek](https://rbouadjenek.github.io/) with the names of the members, their **CodaLab usernames**, the Deakin course in which they are enrolled, and the name of the team.
